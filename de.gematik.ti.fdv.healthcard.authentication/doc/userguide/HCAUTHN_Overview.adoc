=== Authenticator

The Authenticator class implements the IAuthenticator<T> interface which provides functionalities 'getCertificateValue' and 'signData'.
Owner of the certificate (certificate holder) is in this case the health card (eGK).
The certificate as a byte array can be achieved with 'getCertificateValue' from the health card.
A hashValue of byte-array can be signed by 'signData' which result will be returned back as 'AuthenticationResult'.

=== AuthenticationController

The AuthenticationController class handles card events and returns the recognized health card as the certificate holder.

=== Solution with health card (eGK)

A eGK of generation 2.0 or 2.1 should be used in this solution.
The certificate for eGK G2.0 is 'C_CH_AUT_R2048', whereas for eGK G2.1 it is then 'C_CH_AUT_E256'.
Details about signing are available in "gemSpec_Frontend_Vers" of ePA.
